This file should start
with a username followed
by a colon and then 64
characters (32 bytes)
of a base16 string
generated via a secure
random source. This can
be done via the command:
openssl rand --hex 32
The username supports all
characters / byte values
besides colon. Any text
after the key is ignored
(such as this text).
